# Flickr Image Gallery
Test task for the course [React RS School](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/react) with the use of Flickr API

It's a simple web application to search for images written in **React** . 
It also has a form to submit user information.

Try out now on <https://olgad21.github.io/img-gallery>

## I used

- React Custom App State
- Redux
- React hook form
